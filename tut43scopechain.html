<!-- scope chain -->
<!-- The scope chain is used to resolve the value of variable names in javascript. -->
<!-- Scope chain in javascript is lexically defined which means the we can see what the scope chain will be by looking at the code. -->
<!-- At the top of the scope chain is the global scope,which is the window object in the browser. -->

<!-- Lexical scoping:a function that is lexiclly within another funciton get access to the scope of the outer function.(Inner function can get access to their parent functions variables But the vice-versa is not true). -->
