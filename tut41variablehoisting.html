<script>
    //variable hoisting
    //Hoisting in javascript mechanism where variables and functions declarations are moved to the top of their scope before the code execution.
    console.log(a);
    var a;
    a=10;
   
</script>


after hoisting
<script>
    var a;
    console.log(a);//value will be undefined
    a=10;
</script>
